# Leghato
The virtual music marketplace
### HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
    
 Over the past decade, the music industry has experienced significant transformations due to technological advancements and the digital revolution. The rise of streaming services, online music platforms, and social media has opened up new opportunities for musicians to reach a wider audience and promote their work. However, there was still a need for a dedicated platform that connects musicians and music-related services with potential clients in a more targeted and efficient manner.
    
The idea of creating a platform that bridges the gap between musicians and their potential clients is not new. Online marketplaces and platforms catering to various creative industries have emerged, offering services ranging from freelance work to event bookings. These platforms have demonstrated the value of connecting service providers with customers in a centralized and user-friendly manner.
    
 In recent years, platforms focusing specifically on connecting musicians and clients have gained popularity. These platforms allow musicians to showcase their talent, create professional profiles, and offer their services to interested clients. They provide a convenient way for clients to search, discover, and connect with musicians based on their specific needs and preferences.
    
 Leghato is a response to the demand for such a platform, specifically targeting the University of Ibadan community and residents of Oyo State, Nigeria initially, with plans for future expansion. The aim is to provide a centralized hub where musicians, studios, instrument vendors, and music teachers can create profiles, showcase their work, connect with potential clients, and facilitate bookings and collaborations.
    
The historical background of the Leghato project is rooted in the digital transformation of the music industry, the success of existing platforms connecting creative professionals, and the recognition of the need for a dedicated platform catering to the unique requirements of musicians, studios, vendors, and teachers. It aims to leverage technology to enhance the visibility, accessibility, and connectivity within the local music community and provide a valuable resource for musicians and clients alike.

  ### PROBLEM STATEMENT
    
 The music industry lacks centralized platforms that effectively connects musicians, music studios, instrument vendors, music teachers, and potential clients in a specific geographical area, such as the University of Ibadan community and Oyo State in Nigeria. Musicians struggle to showcase their talent and services, studios face challenges in reaching out to potential clients, instrument vendors lack a dedicated platform to showcase their products, and individuals seeking music lessons find it difficult to connect with qualified teachers. There is a need for a mobile application that addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive platform where musicians can create professional profiles, studios can showcase their facilities and booking terms, instrument vendors can present virtual showrooms, and music teachers can connect with students. Furthermore, potential clients require a convenient way to discover and access nearby music services. Leghato project aims to bridge these gaps and establish a robust ecosystem that benefits musicians, studios, instrument vendors, teachers, and clients within the specified geographical area.
    
   - People don't know how close they are to products or services they need. 
    
   - There is so much stress attached to finding a studio in a new environment, or booking for a studio session, or looking for a music teacher, or the right musicians and vocalists for a session or live gig, or even finding the best deal for music gadgets.

   ### PROJECT OVERVIEW
   ##### - A Brief Overview of this Platform:
    
 Leghato aim to connect musicians, music studios, instrument vendors, and music teachers with potential clients. It will be developed as a mobile application and initially targeted towards the University of Ibadan community and residents of Oyo State, Nigeria. The platform will provide a user-friendly interface for musicians to create professional profiles and portfolios, showcasing their best works, location, and services offered. Studios will have the ability to make their facilities visible to the public, showcase their equipment and capacity, provide booking terms, and highlight their services. Instrument vendors will be able to create virtual showrooms to showcase their products. Additionally, music teachers can connect with students seeking lessons. The platform will utilize location-based services to enable potential clients to easily find the music services closest to them when needed. As the platform becomes successful, there are plans to expand its coverage to other states within Nigeria and eventually across Africa. The project will involve the development of a mobile application, a phased rollout plan, user acquisition strategies, and monetization options. The project's success will be evaluated based on metrics such as user engagement, connections made, and user feedback.

### MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT


💡 Some key considerations when developing the Music Connect platform as a mobile application for both iOS and Android platforms:

1. **Responsive Design:** Ensure that the mobile application is designed with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions. This will provide a consistent user experience across various mobile devices.
2. **Mobile-Friendly Navigation:** Optimize the navigation structure for mobile devices by using intuitive and mobile-specific navigation patterns, such as tab bars, hamburger menus, or bottom navigation bars. This allows users to easily access different sections of the application.
3. **Simplified User Interface:** Streamline the user interface to display relevant information and actions prominently, avoiding clutter and excessive text. Utilize icons, images, and clear call-to-action buttons to enhance usability and minimize user effort.
4. **Touch-Friendly Interactions:** Mobile devices rely on touch interactions, so ensure that buttons, links, and interactive elements are appropriately sized and spaced to accommodate finger taps accurately. Use visual feedback, such as animations or changes in button appearance, to provide a responsive touch experience.
5. **Performance Optimization:** Mobile applications should be optimized for performance and efficiency. Minimize loading times, implement data caching where applicable, and optimize image sizes to reduce bandwidth consumption and improve overall responsiveness.
6. **Offline Capability:** Consider incorporating offline functionality to allow users to access certain features or previously loaded content even when they have limited or no internet connectivity. This can include features like saved searches, cached profiles, or offline messaging.
7. **Push Notifications:** Implement push notifications to keep users engaged and informed about important updates, such as new messages, booking confirmations, or upcoming events. However, ensure that the notifications are relevant and offer value to the user.
8. **Device Integration:** Leverage mobile device capabilities such as camera, location services, and contacts to enhance the user experience. For example, users can upload photos, utilize geolocation for searching nearby services, or import contacts for easier communication.
9.  **App Store Guidelines:** Follow the design guidelines and best practices provided by Apple's App Store (for iOS) and Google Play Store (for Android). Adhering to these guidelines ensures that the application meets the platform-specific requirements and provides a consistent experience to users.
10. **Usability Testing:** Conduct thorough usability testing on mobile devices throughout the development process. Identify and address any usability issues or inconsistencies to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.

### Alternatively,
I'm considering a nocode platform. It will save time and cost, but will not necessarily make all the features functional. However, it is worth using for the initial phase.
